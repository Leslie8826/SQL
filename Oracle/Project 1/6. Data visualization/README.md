### 6. Data visualization
With dml statements we could query the table and get the information we needed to get the company analyzed.

#### 6.1 Visualizing with Tableau
In Tableau, we used 2 ways to load the data
##### 6.1.1 From a csv/excel file 
(that reflect the most recent data updates of our hr_stage table)
##### 6.1.2 From our database 
  (we logged to our database directly from Tableau using our database login credentials)
