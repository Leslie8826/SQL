4. Creation of stage table <br>
We also created a stage table where we inserted all the data that exist from the excel file HR_Data.xlsx (attached here). <br>
To get the data loaded in a table, we did the following: 
   - we clicked on the import-data option when right-click on Tables in SQL Developer. 
   - we chose the file HR_data.xlsx that is locally on our computer
   - we selected the import method (insert) and the define the name of table that will be generated
   - we selected the columns to import from the data set and arrange them in the order we wanted. At this stage we could select  at minimum one column or all of them. We selected all the columns that are in the HR_Data.xlsx 
   - for each column, we defined the column details of the table that would be created
   - we validated the creation of the stage table by clicking on the finish button
   - if an error occurred, we simply redid the process and changed what needed to be changed
