### 3. Creation of our database
We created our database with ddl statements using Oracle SQL Developer from the database model built in point 2. The output after running the statements can be seen in output.txt

The database is not locally built on my own computer but on a server. To create the database, I had to create a ssh tunnel to connect with the server. Then I used a script to get into the space created for me on this server.
