## Overview
We are given an excel file, HR_data.xlsx, with a lot of data on a company's employees. We are asked to:
  - Design a database model according to the excel file
  - Create a database from the model created
  - Insert the data that appear in the excel file into the newly created database
  - Query the data from the database to get the information needed
  - Use Tableau Software to visualize the data

## How we did it
1. Brainstorming <br>
We analyzed the excel file and came up with a list of categories based upon the type of data. Each category would represent a table in our database. We wrote everyting on paper.

2. Designing the database model <br>
We draw each table on paper and added the relationships between tables when necessary, which formed our data model. Then we draw our data model in SQL Modeler.

3. Database creation
